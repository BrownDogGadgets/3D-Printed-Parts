# 7 Segment Display Holder

This is a LEGO compatible file that holds a [7 Segment Display](https://www.browndoggadgets.com/products/7-segment-display) for mounting onto a LEGO baseplate or bricks.

The 7 Segment Display slides into the holder and is held in place by friction. If the fit is a bit too tight you can file or sand the inside holding arms of the print.

This file can be printed on a standard FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) desktop printer without support.
