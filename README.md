# 3D Printed Parts

These are custom 3D printed parts that make it easy to hold a variety of electronic components we use at [Brown Dog Gadgets](https://www.browndoggadgets.com/).

They are LEGO compatible, and are meant to be attached to a LEGO baseplate or bricks.

The files can be printed on a standard FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) desktop printer without support.
