# 2AAA Battery Holder with Holes

This is a LEGO Technic compatible file that holds a [2AAA Battery Holder](https://www.browndoggadgets.com/products/aaa-battery-holder-double) for mounting onto LEGO Technic Beams.

The battery pack sits inside the holder loosely. If you want a more secure fit you can add some tape to hold the battery pack into place.

This file can be printed on a standard FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) desktop printer without support.
