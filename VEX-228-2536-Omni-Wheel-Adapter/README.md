# VEX 228-2536 Omni Wheel Adapter

This is a LEGO compatible file that works as an adapter to allow for the [VEX 200mm Travel Omni-Directional Wheel](https://www.vexrobotics.com/228-2536.html) to work with LEGO Technic Axles.

There is a 3mm version and a 4mm version. The 4mm version will fit snug, and the 3mm version will have a bit more play.

This file can be printed on a standard FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) desktop printer. You may need support for this one depending on your printer, but you can try a print without support first to see if it works.

## Assembly Hardware

You will need 4 bolts (12mm in length) as well as 4 matching hex nuts. You should choose either 4mm bolts or 3mm bolts depending on which adapters you print.
