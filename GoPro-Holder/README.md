# GoPro Camera Holder

This is a LEGO compatible file that holds a [GoPro HERO3 Camera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009PK9S90/) for mounting onto a LEGO baseplate or bricks.

The GoPro sits inside the holder loosely. If you want a more secure fit you can add some tape to hold the camera into place.

This file can be printed on a standard FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) desktop printer without support.
