# PIR Sensor Holder

This is a LEGO compatible file that holds a [PIR Sensor](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B012ZZ4LPM/) for mounting onto a LEGO baseplate or bricks.

The PIR Sensor slides into the holder and is held in place by gravity.

This file can be printed on a standard FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) desktop printer without support.
