# Tape Roll Holder

Files for a 3D printed tape roll holder that can be used with Maker Tape from Brown Dog Gadgets.

These files can be printed on a standard FFF (Fused Filament Fabrication) desktop printer without support.

We've separated the 1/4" wide tape and the 1/8" wide tape into separate directories.
